"This study presents a new system and control design for an active tool holder that can effectively suppress vibration and chatter in internal turning. The controller accounts for the influence of tool deflection during a preceding cut affecting the dynamics of the current cut, a key source of instability in machining processes. To deal with variability in dynamic behavior due to changing of the tool mounting conditions and overhang length, a robust H-infinity controller is synthesized based on a linear-parameter-varying (LPV) description of the machining dynamics. The parametric dependence allows the robustness levels and modal properties of the control system to be easily tuned in a workshop setting to achieve the best possible vibration reduction performance. The controller design accounts for the time-delayed feedback from cutting forces, and also the need to avoid spillover instability of unmodeled high frequency modes. The method is applied using a tool holder that integrates piezoelectric bending actuators and strain sensors in such a way that the overall size and shape of the tool is unaltered, thereby providing the functionality and ease of operation necessary for widespread adoption in manufacturing industries. Experiments conducted on a lathe machine demonstrate that root-mean-square vibration levels can be reduced by over 95% (and peak-to-peak values reduced by approximately 90%) in unstable cutting regimes, allowing high material removal rates with good surface finish.

Quality programs, particularly Six Sigma, have emerged as indispensable tools for achieving organizational excellence by emphasizing defect reduction and process variation control. However, challenges arise in quality 4.0 environments, especially when confronting issues unrelated to Six Sigma principles, unstructured data, or large datasets, necessitating additional data-driven methodologies. This article aims to review the evolving needs of quality 4.0 by investigating complementary data-driven methodologies to Six Sigma and exploring untapped opportunities through their integration. Employing the Methodi Ordinatio as a systematic literature review method, we organize and synthesize existing literature on the integration of Six Sigma and industry 4.0 in the context of quality 4.0. Our findings reveal a critical gap in integration, emphasizing the necessity for a comprehensive framework. We identify a collection of methodologies that enhance each stage of the Six Sigma process, including Execution Framework (Agile), Define (Value Stream Mapping), Measure (Process Mining), Analysis (Simulation), Improvement (MCDM), and Control (Big Data).

The Companies Act 1956 concerned itself more with procedural matters. It was only in 1990s and later that focus shifted towards internal governance of companies. Financial markets reforms and establishment of SEBI focused on cleaning up the trading system, introducing market-based pricing in IPOs, controlling securities market frauds and market manipulation, prevention of insider trading, drawing up transparency in laws regarding substantial acquisition and takeover of companies. To reduce chances of manipulation, rules were also framed for minimum public shareholding in listed companies.

The Companies Act, The SEBI Act and its regulations, The IBC and a host of other related acts and regulations impose mandatory provisions on companies and their employees/directors about the actions they must take, the manner of taking such actions and what they must avoid. For example, there are eligibility criteria and disqualification provisions for the directors. The director has to act in good faith and perform duties with reasonable care, skill and diligence and avoid any conflict of interest. There are specific provisions regarding manner, standards and timelines for publishing financial statements, calling the meetings of the board and its committees and calling the AGM. Any violation can attract penal action against the management as well as against the director. Non-executive and independent directors have fiduciary duties and are liable for acts or omissions of the company which occurred with their knowledge, attributable through board process, with their consent or connivance or where they have not acted diligently. The IBC has provisions to hold directors personally liable when there are incipient signs of weakness in the company and the directors have not acted in the best interests of the creditors.

"The bigger concern is the governance in PSEs. In order to have the moral authority to strengthen governance in privately-held companies, government need to establish higher standards in the companies it owns or controls. Unfortunately, the situation has not improved over several decades. The mechanism being adopted are three-fold, by having specific carve -outs in laws passed by the Parliament, by having special provisions in the rules and regulations framed by the executive or the regulator, and finally, by seeking case to case special exemptions. There hardly seems any justification in law to exempt timely publication of accounts, or for non-payment of debt, or inaction in case of default by companies. Delaying operation of MPS provisions endlessly, and that too by using the sovereign power of the government or not appointing adequate women directors does not set a good example of the country being highly sensitive towards setting high governance standards.",10.1016/j.accoth.2024.100001,Accounting Theory and Practice,2024,0,,,,,,,,,,

For the government to effectively advocate for stronger corporate governance in privately held companies, it must first uphold the highest standards within the entities it owns or controls. However, despite decades of discussion, meaningful improvements remain elusive. Governance frameworks in PSEs often rely on three mechanisms: legal carve-outs in parliamentary legislation, special provisions embedded in executive or regulatory rules, and case-by-case exemptions. These practices raise fundamental concerns, as there is little legal justification for exempting timely financial disclosures, delaying debt repayments, or neglecting action in cases of corporate default. The indefinite deferral of Minimum Public Shareholding (MPS) requirements, often through sovereign authority, along with the failure to ensure adequate representation of women on boards, undermines the nations commitment to strong governance principles.

"Experiments to measure oxygen opacity at stellar interior conditions have been performed at the National Ignition Facility in a Discovery Science campaign. These experiments utilize the Opacity-on-NIF platform with a sample comprised of O, Mg, and Si. The spectral data from the Opacity Spectrometer cover the 10002000 eV photon energy range showing bound-free continuum absorption from O and line absorption from Mg and Si. DANTE and the Gated X-ray Detector are employed to measure the sample plasmas temperature and density, respectively. Initial data show lower transmission than expected by theoretical models, raising questions of whether potential background or data uniformity concerns could produce systematic errors in the inferred transmission. Here, we investigate three concerns thought to be important for the oxygen opacity data, including instrumental scattered background, sample self-emission non-uniformity, and backlight continuum non-uniformity. Additionally, we show the effect of a recently developed method to account for 2nd order crystal reflection. The total effect of these concerns on one experiment is found to be small compared to the observed difference between the inferred transmission and a model calculation at the inferred temperature and density.

"The remodeling phase, the last step of wound healing, can last anywhere from a few months to many years and aims to improve the tissue's structural integrity, strength, and flexibility. Fibroblasts are crucial at this point because they help collagen fibers cross-link and reorganize, significantly increasing the wound site's tensile strength.

"Interpreted as a solution to employment and productivity stagnation and, more recently, to protect the EU economy from undesirable and critical dependence, back-shoring is strongly advocated by the European Union in its Open Strategic Autonomy. However, the effects of industrial activities brought back to their initial location are not just positive. The phenomenon hides potentially negative consequences that need to be highlighted in order to be anticipated and tackled with mitigating policies. The aim of this paper is to measure the social consequences of back-shoring at the local level. By measuring the effect that back-shoring has on wages of high- vs low-skilled workers in the manufacturing sector at NUTS2 level, a double dark side of back-shoring emerges. The results show in fact that within regions, back-shoring has a negative effect on low-skilled workers wages and a neutral effect on high-skilled ones. Moreover, it shows that the detrimental effects of back-shoring on low-skilled workers concentrates in less economically developed areas, while the beneficial ones on high-skilled workers concentrates in more developed area. These results suggest an increase in both intra and inter regional disparities.

Our findings reveal a ""double dark side"" to back-shoring: a detrimental effect on the wages of low-skilled workers and no significant effect on high-skilled workers. The adverse impact on low-skilled wages is particularly concentrated in economically disadvantaged regions, while the benefits for high-skilled workers are more prominent in wealthier areas.

"Place-based policies had a bad reputation for decades, if they received any attention at all. This has recently changed, for two reasons. First, many countries have experienced political backlashes from rising spatial economic disparities. Populist movements received the highest support in economically backward regions, which had been hit by severe local shocks. By trying to foster spatial economic cohesion, regional policies have become an attempt to insure against those political trends and to save liberal democracies altogether. Second, recent theoretical and empirical research has challenged the leading paradigm of spatial equilibrium analysis, according to which place-based policies are an inefficient interference into the market-based resource allocation. In this paper, I review those arguments and how their balance has changed over time. I argue that the demand for place-based policies is likely to increase in the future, as new digital technologies might reinforce urban-rural divides.

On the one hand, a tougher firm selection can raise consumer welfare, because more productive firms typically offer better and cheaper products as they pass on their cost advantages at least partly to consumers. More productive firms typically also pay higher wages, which pushes up the earnings of employees in those firms. At the same time, this can lead to a widening dispersion in household incomes when wages in other, non-superstar firms tend to stagnate or even decline in the process of rising market concentration. This becomes more likely when the dominance of superstar firms becomes so prevalent that it discourages the investment efforts of laggard firms, who see no realistic chance to challenge incumbent market leaders and who consequently refrain from investments in process and product innovations even at ultra-low interest rates.",10.1016/j.gcrs.2024.100003,Global Challenges & Regional Science,2024,0,,,,,,,,,,

"The trajectory of productivity growth is increasingly intertwined with regional economic disparities, especially as OECD nations transition from manufacturing to knowledge-based industries. This transformation is driving urban economic concentration, a pattern that digitalization is expected to reinforce. While forecasts vary on which jobs will decline or flourish, most analysts anticipate that the overall employment level will remain stable. However, the composition and geographic spread of jobs are poised for significant shifts, potentially exacerbating the divide between dynamic urban centers and economically lagging rural or industrial areas.",10.1016/j.gcrs.2024.100003,Global Challenges & Regional Science,2024,1,,,,,,,,,,
"This surprising difference is rooted in inefficiencies of the initial spatial equilibrium. There is a mix of positive and negative externalities embedded in the framework that individuals ignore in their private location decisions, representing different agglomeration and congestion forces. In the initial equilibrium, large cities tend to be too large from a social point of view, although interregional transport costs and market size effects can work against this tendency. Fiscal transfers effectively countervail over-congestion, because they provide incentives for workers to reside outside the big cities. This can be welfare-enhancing, especially if transport costs for goods are not too large and if the recipient areas are not too remotely located. And vice versa, abolishing the existing transfers can have adverse welfare effects, despite the associated productivity gains, because it makes the problem of over-congestion in large cities even worse.",10.1016/j.gcrs.2024.100003,Global Challenges & Regional Science,2024,0,,,,,,,,,,

"To mention a few, a first problem arises from the fact that multiple programs co-exist in parallel, some of which overlap, interact or even have conflicting goals. It might therefore be difficult for researchers to attribute economic effects to just one particular intervention, because the impacts of all other policies would have to be properly controlled for.

"A few key challenges arise when evaluating place-based policies. First, multiple programs often coexist simultaneously, some overlapping, interacting, or even conflicting with each other. This makes it difficult for researchers to isolate the economic effects of a single intervention, as the impacts of other policies must be properly controlled for. In practice, achieving such clinical ceteris paribus conditions is rarely possible. Second, external validity is a concern: just because a policy has succeeded (or failed) in one context, it does not guarantee the same outcome in different settings. The parameters, such as the availability of other policies not considered in a study, can vary significantly across contexts. Lastly, many empirical evaluations focus on partial effects, often neglecting the broader general equilibrium consequences. For instance, studies may evaluate whether a specific subsidy has a measurable effect on an outcome like employment or productivity, but they usually do not account for the full welfare impact of the policysuch as whether the same funds might have been more effective if allocated differently, or whether the benefits outweigh the economic costs of financing the subsidy through taxation.

"The second type is mostly for old industrial regions with long-term legacies.

This will work better if existing competencies and skills are transitioned into new, yet related business areas. For instance, bringing this discussion to contemporaneous and future challenges, it should probably be the first priority to equip current production workers of combustion engines with the necessary skills to become specialists for electric vehicles; chances are, they might be even better prepared for those tasks than new workers without any experience and accumulated specific human capital in the automotive industry.

"A key ingredient to facilitate this strategy are investments into education, including on-the-job training schemes as firms transform their business models. The financing of those human capital investments is partly in the interest of firms and workers themselves, since they contain job-specific skills. However, there are also good economic reasons for government co-involvement, including via the design of place-based policies. The reasons are twofold. First, at least some parts of the education investments will concern general and transferable skills, for instance in cases where firms cannot retain all workers during their transition, which in turn requires some job switches across industries. Firms have little incentive to provide such training out of their own pocket, but it effectively requires cost sharing by public policy. Second, education investments are needed to adapt the set of skills provided to the young generation, in order to equip them with the necessary human capital for the changed local industrial structure.",10.1016/j.gcrs.2024.100003,Global Challenges & Regional Science,2024,0,,,,,,,,,,

"The traditional discussion about place-based policies strongly emphasized deadweight-losses and followed a zero-sum logic: A Euro that is invested in the unproductive periphery may distort location choices, and in the end do more harm than good. Had the same Euro been invested in thriving cities, it would have produced a higher economic rate of return, hence more tax revenue. It would have enlarged the pie available for re-distribution, and thereby facilitated more income transfers to residents of peripheral regions (subsidize people, not places).

The second mechanism explores the possibility that rural elderly tends to be religious believers for the reason of being neglected by the formal pension assistance (economic compensation channel). According to the Schultz hypothesis, religious belief of rural elderly people may be motivated by value rationality or economic rationality, but the existing literature does not provide theory and empirical evidence on these alternative mechanisms in China.

"The proportion of religious believers varies greatly in different countries. On the one hand, for caesaropapism countries (union of politics and religion), the proportion of the elderly who believe in religion is high. On the other hand, for religious freedom countries, the proportion of elderly who believe in religion is relatively lower. As a country with religious freedom, China has a long history of religion, but the spread of religion domestically has not been smooth sailing. Buddhism was first introduced to China fromIndiain the 1st century A.D. and entered a stage of prosperity from the Southern and Northern Dynasties. In the late Eastern Han Dynasty, religious groups such as Huang Laodao, Taiping Dao, and Tianshi Dao were established and formed the rudiment of Taoism, which originated in China. The earliest exact record for the introduction of Christianity into China was in 635A.D. (during Emperor Taizongs rule of the Tang Dynasty), or about 16 years earlier than the introduction of Islam from Arabia to China (during Emperor Yonghuis rule of the Tang Dynasty). However, religious believers have declined sharply since the founding of the Peoples Republic of China in 1949 due to the Communist Party of China adherence to atheism at that time. Nevertheless, with the termination of theCultural Revolutionand the beginning of opening up in 1978, about 2 million temples have been rebuilt all over China. During this period, China has held a more open attitude towards religion and carried out many religious reforms, including the establishment of areligious educationsystem and the development of academic research for religion.

"Although the extant literature has examined the relationship between religion and self-employment, overall, no consensus has been reached. Some studies show that religion has a significantly positive effect on self-employment in developed countries and mainly focus on secular religions such asProtestantism, Catholicism, and Islam, while others take the opposite opinion that religion has no effect on self-employment. However, studies on self-employment of rural elderly in China are scarce with little evidence on whether religions, specifically Buddhism and Taoism, play a role in encouraging their self-employment. The reasons why we choose China for our research object are as follows. First, Chinas rural elderly population has reached 267 million in 2021.However, the vast majority of rural elderly do not have a paid-job income, yet enough physical strength for agricultural production, which making self-employment the only means for rural elderly, especially left-behind elderly, to obtain economic income. Thus, self-employment of rural elderly people are not only playing an important role in Chinas rural development, but also have critical influence on maintaining social stability. Nevertheless, there are no empirical studies comprehensively analyzing the phenomenon of rural elderlies self-employment in China. Second, different from the countryside of developed countries, the social security system such as pension and medical assistance in rural China is still imperfect, and informal institutional arrangements, such as social norms and religious belief, may play more positive role in economic behavior through supplementing the formal social insurance. The focus on this Chinese background should bring new insight into the economic consequences of religious belief and complement to the existing literature of self-employment.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,

"China presents a compelling case for study. By 2021, its rural elderly population had grown to 267 million, with many individuals lacking formal employment but still physically capable of agricultural work. For left-behind elderly individuals, self-employment is often the only viable means of generating income, making it crucial for rural development and social stability. Despite its importance, this issue has received little empirical attention. Furthermore, unlike rural areas in developed nations, where robust social security systems provide support, Chinas rural pension and medical assistance programs remain inadequate. This gap suggests that informal institutionssuch as religious belief and social normsmay play a crucial role in economic decision-making by supplementing formal social insurance. Examining this dynamic in the Chinese context provides new perspectives on the intersection of religion and economic behavior, enriching the broader discourse on self-employment.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,1,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, no comprehensive empirical studies have analyzed this issue.

"As far as the rural elderly are concerned, the construction of social network, the accumulation of religious human capital, and the participation in informal social security are all important channels that link the religious belief and self-employment choice. First, social networks constructed by congregation provide the necessary resources and employment opportunities for the rural elderly. Furthermore, religious network makes it easier to obtain occupational information and job guarantees from other religious believers due to trust mechanism, thus encourage rural elderly with religious belief to re-enter the labor market in the form of self-employment. Second, compared with non-believing rural elderly, rural elderly people with religious belief accumulate human capital through religious education. The higher human capital increase work efficiency and work ability of rural elderly people with religious belief, which also help self-employment. Third, one reason on why the probability of self-employment among the elderly in rural areas is low is mainly because of the absence of formal pension insurance and medical assistance. That is, lack of security has led to the opportunity cost (risk of failure) of self-employment is very high. In order to reduce the opportunity costs (risk of failure) of self-employment, rural elderly people will seek alternative channels to provide informal security such as religious association. Therefore, compared to rural elderly people without religious belief, rural elderly believers are easier to be self-employed because the latter have lower opportunity costs (risk of failure) though risk-sharing of informal security.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,
"For rural elderly individuals, religious belief plays a crucial role in self-employment through three primary mechanisms: social network formation, religious human capital accumulation, and informal social security participation. First, religious congregations create social networks that offer vital resources and employment opportunities. These networks foster trust, enabling elderly religious individuals to access occupational information and job guarantees from fellow believers, which promotes self-employment. Second, religious belief helps rural elderly accumulate human capital through religious education, boosting their work efficiency and abilities, thus supporting self-employment. Lastly, the absence of formal pension insurance and medical assistance in rural areas increases the opportunity costs of self-employment. To mitigate these risks, religious elderly turn to informal security through religious associations, lowering the overall risks and costs of self-employment. As a result, rural elderly believers face fewer barriers and are more likely to pursue self-employment compared to their non-believing counterparts",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,1,,,,,,,,,,

Our findings mirror those in non-state-religious contexts, where individuals are often motivated to pursue religion for economic rather than value-driven purposes.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,1,,,,,,,,,,
"Empirical evidence indicates that religious belief plays a role in creating a social network for congregants, primarily through relationship-based consumption, but it also reduces the reliance on formal insurance systems and alternative formal education. This suggests that religion does not always lead to positive economic outcomes. Nonetheless, the significance of the findings affirms that religion does influence individual behavior through economic rationality. In particular, the economic compensation effect of religious belief appears to be more prominent than value rationality. This outcome aligns with research in non-theocratic countries, which suggests that individuals pursuit of religion is often driven by economic rather than value-based motivations.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,1,,,,,,,,,,
"As the most populous country in the world, China has lifted more than 800 million rural people out of poverty as of the end of 2020. This historical contribution is coupled with increasing self-employment among its rural elderly. Despite the introduction of several rural security measures, self-employment in rural China is still common. The literature has addressed concerns for the influence of age, medical insurance,child care, family resources, and other economic determinations on self-employment, but scant evidence is provided on whether and how culture especially religious belief - a general cultural phenomenon - affects the choice of employment. Our study fills this gap and examines the impact of religious belief on self-employment of rural elderly in the context of Chinasrural revitalizationstrategy.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,
"China, being the most populous country globally, has successfully lifted over 800 million rural residents out of poverty by the end of 2020. This remarkable achievement is accompanied by a growing trend of self-employment among the rural elderly. Despite the implementation of various rural security initiatives, self-employment remains widespread in rural China. While existing literature explores factors such as age, medical insurance, child care, family resources, and other economic determinants influencing self-employment, there is limited research on the role of cultureparticularly religious beliefin shaping employment decisions. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the influence of religious beliefs on the self-employment choices of the rural elderly, within the framework of Chinas rural revitalization strategy.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,1,,,,,,,,,,
"As the world's most populous nation, China has successfully lifted over 800 million rural citizens out of poverty by the close of 2020. This monumental achievement goes hand-in-hand with a rising trend of self-employment among the rural elderly. Despite the introduction of several rural security measures, self-employment continues to be prevalent in rural areas. While previous research has examined the impact of factors such as age, medical insurance, child care, and family resources on self-employment, there is little exploration of how cultural factors, particularly religious beliefs, influence employment choices.

"Using a unique survey dataset of thousands of rural Chinese villages collected from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in 2014, we find that religious belief has a positive and significant impact on self-employment of rural elderly. Further analyses show that belief in Buddhism and Christianity has a significantly positive effect, but believing in Taoism and native religion has a negative effect. There is no evidence that belief in Islam has a significant impact on the self-employment of rural elderly in China.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,

"Leveraging a unique survey dataset from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, encompassing thousands of rural Chinese villages in 2014, this study finds a substantial positive correlation between religious belief and self-employment among the rural elderly. Detailed analysis indicates that adherence to Buddhism and Christianity significantly boosts self-employment, while belief in Taoism and indigenous religions tends to have a negative impact. Interestingly, there is no evidence suggesting that Islam influences the self-employment of rural elderly in China.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,1,,,,,,,,,,
"Utilizing a distinctive survey dataset from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, covering thousands of rural Chinese villages in 2014, our study reveals a significant positive relationship between religious belief and self-employment among the elderly in rural areas. Further analysis shows that belief in Buddhism and Christianity is strongly associated with increased self-employment, while belief in Taoism and indigenous religions is linked to lower self-employment rates. Additionally, there is no substantial evidence to suggest that belief in Islam has a notable impact on the self-employment of rural elderly individuals in China.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,1,,,,,,,,,,
"The above results still steadily remain after using instrumental variables and PSM approach, indicating that the level of a countrys self-employment mainly depends on its main religion regardless of the sizes of different religions. Analysis of heterogeneous samples reveals that elderly religious believers who are female, over 70 years old, living in a village where the secondary industry is dominant and soybeans/potatoes the main crops are more likely to became self-employees. We also control for village variables to address the alternative hypothesis, and our results remain robust. We obtain evidence that religious belief has a positive effect on self-employment through constructing a social network, squeezing out formal insurance security, and alternating formal education, which indicate that compared to value recognition effect the economic compensation effect of religious belief is dominant.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,

"The robustness of our findings is upheld even when applying instrumental variables and the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) approach, suggesting that a countrys level of self-employment is predominantly influenced by its primary religion, independent of the size of other religions. Further analysis of heterogeneous samples indicates that elderly religious individuals, particularly females over 70 years old, residing in villages with a secondary industry focus and where soybeans or potatoes are the primary crops, are more inclined to pursue self-employment. After accounting for village-specific variables to control for alternative explanations, our results remain consistent. The evidence demonstrates that religious belief positively impacts self-employment by fostering social networks, reducing reliance on formal insurance, and compensating for the absence of formal education. This highlights the dominant economic compensation effect of religious belief, which outweighs the value recognition effect.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,1,,,,,,,,,,
"Our findings remain robust even after applying instrumental variables and the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method, indicating that the level of self-employment in a country is predominantly influenced by its dominant religion, irrespective of the size of other religious groups. Further analysis of heterogeneous samples shows that elderly religious individuals, especially women over 70, living in villages where the secondary sector is predominant and soybeans or potatoes are the primary crops, have a higher likelihood of self-employment. After controlling for village-specific variables to address potential confounding factors, the results remain consistent. We provide evidence that religious belief positively impacts self-employment through the development of social networks, reduction of reliance on formal insurance, and compensation for limited formal education. These findings suggest that the economic compensation effect of religious belief is more influential than the value recognition effect in driving self-employment.",10.1016/j.asieco.2022.101548,Journal of Asian Economics,2022,1,,,,,,,,,,
